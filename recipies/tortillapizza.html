    <h3><aside>Description</aside></h3>
    <p>This tortilla pizza is extremely easy to make. It is light enough to be a snack, serves well as an appetizer, or is so good that it can be devoured alone! You can use any sort of topping variation. The one below is the classic way I usually prepare it but feel free to experiment.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tortilla: </strong>Use store-bought or homemade soft flour tortillas.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil: </strong>Brush the tortillas with olive oil before you season them. </li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings: </strong>These tortilla pizzas are seasoned with garlic powder, black pepper, and dried oregano. </li>
        <li><strong>Tomato sauce: </strong>Use store-bought or homemade tomato sauce. </li>
        <li><strong>Toppings: </strong>op the tortilla pizzas with sliced chicken breast, green bell pepper, and green onions. Of course, you can customize the toppings to suit your taste. </li>
        <li><strong>Cheese: </strong>Finish the pizzas with mozzarella cheese. </li>
    </ul>
